🏭 Predictive Maintenance & Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard
Predictive maintenance and manufacturing efficiency analysis using AI4I 2020 dataset
This project focuses on applying data analytics to manufacturing and maintenance operations using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset.
The objective is to analyze machine performance, identify failure patterns, and derive insights that support predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.

📌 Problem Statement
Unplanned machine downtime leads to production losses, increased maintenance costs, and reduced equipment reliability.
This project aims to use machine sensor data to understand failure behavior, downtime impact, and operational efficiency, enabling data-driven maintenance decisions.
